        <p>
          Tesla was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning and
          was named after inventor Nikola Tesla. Elon Musk became involved as
          chairman in 2004 and later took over as CEO. The company released its
          first electric car, the Roadster, in 2008, which was notable for its
          impressive range and performance[1][5].

        <p>
          Optimus, also known as Tesla Bot, is a general-purpose robotic
          humanoid under development by Tesla. It is designed to perform tasks
          that are dangerous, repetitive, or boring. Elon Musk has stated that
          Optimus could be production-ready by 2023 and could be more
          significant than Tesla's vehicle business[4].
